          <h3>Web Developement & Writing</h3>
          <p class="work">I always wanted to build beatiful websites and create my own magic with them,
             I started web dev in college and haven't stopped since then.
            I started writing poems and short stories when I was 12 years old as a way to express my innermost emotions.
            Over time, I have written several poems, a few short stories and a Novel (not published yet).</p>

          <h3>Scented Candle making</h3>
          <p class="Candless">Chandler, reminds you of the famous tv show friends, doesn't it?
            I am a chandler,
            personality and profession-wise.
            I started making candles just to give a nice scent to my room which slowly turned into
            a hobby, something I
             became passionate about.
             I made candles for fun at first and then started selling them at fairs and exhibitions.</p>
